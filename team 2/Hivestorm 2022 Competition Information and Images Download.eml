Dear Hivestorm Team Captain,

Please share this message with your coach and other team members.  Our apol=
ogies for the text wall, but we want to provide you with as much informatio=
n as we can ahead of time.  Please read this information carefully as failu=
re to do so will cause issues for your team during the competition.

The competition images are now available for download.  You may download, i=
mport, and stage these competition VMs but DO NOT POWER ON ANY COMPETITION =
VMs UNTIL YOU ARE READY TO START YOUR COMPETITION WINDOW.  When you power u=
p any of the competition VMs your team=E2=80=99s 4-hour window starts. Ther=
e is no stopping, pausing, or resetting of competition windows once they=E2=
=80=99ve started.  If your coach, captain, or any team member powers up a c=
ompetition VM before 10 AM Central on Oct 15th your team will be disqualifi=
ed.

Before powering up any competition VMs, make sure the time on your host sys=
tem is correct.  Check that the time zone is correct and the host is displa=
ying the correct time for that time zone.  This is especially critical for =
virtualization environments such as vSphere.  If the time on the system hos=
ting the VMs is wrong/off then it could prevent your VMs from scoring, may =
reduce your team=E2=80=99s competition window, and may prevent you from com=
peting all together.  We cannot make adjustments for host system time or ti=
me zone misconfigurations and will not be responsible for errors caused by =
an incorrect host system time =E2=80=93 be sure the time on your host is co=
rrect before powering up any competition VMs!

There are 5 competition VMs - they may be downloaded from the following lin=

The official competition window runs from 11 AM to 10 PM Central time on Oc=
t 15th.  You can choose when you start playing within that window, but you =
must start and complete your 4-hour competition window within that timefram=
e.  The VMs are set to UTC time - do not modify the time zone on the VMs.  =
You may work on the VMs one at a time or all at the same time just keep in =
mind you have a total of 4 hours from the time you power up that first comp=
etition image to achieve your highest score on all the competition VMs.  Th=
e scoring server will stop =E2=80=9Ccounting=E2=80=9D scores for every team=
 after their 4 hours is up so don=E2=80=99t worry if you see teams with a r=
untime longer than 4 hours on the scoreboard (that just shows you which tea=
ms didn=E2=80=99t power off their VMs when they were finished =E2=80=93 the=
y=E2=80=99re not getting a longer play window or extra time).

You can use Discord to communicate with the Hivestorm Team during the compe=
tition.  The Discord link is https://discord.gg/u9Rwt4TZ.  Please identify =
yourself with your team number on the Discord server.  This Discord server =
is only manned during competition hours.

A few technical notes to assist your team in this competition:

  *   Check your downloads =E2=80=93 SHA1 sums are provided above with the =
link to each VM.  VMs are distributed in OVA format.
  *   These VMs should work fine on the latest versions of VMWare Player/Wo=
rkstation/ESXi/vSphere.  You may be able to import and run them using Virtu=
alBox, Proxmox, or Hyper-V but these are not officially supported solutions=
 and we will not be able to help you get the VMs running in a non-supported=
 environment.
  *   If you are importing these VMs onto a platform without a sound card (=
like a server) you may want to remove the sound device from the VMs configu=
ration before you power them up.  If you do not remove the sound device bef=
ore powering the VM on a server platform you will get a prompt indicating t=
he VM can't find a sound device and asking if you want to look for a sound =
device each time the VM restarts.  You can safely answer "no" to that quest=
ion.  Check the monitor tab in your web client for that VM if you don't see=
 a pop-up question.
  *   These VMs are setup for "NAT" which means they are designed to share =
the IP address of the host system.  You can modify the VMs to use DHCP or s=
tatic IP addresses to fit your operating environment.
  *   Enter your team's Unique ID into each VM as soon as you power them up=
.  You won't get any score or feedback until you do and the VM will deactiv=
ate after a period of time without a valid Unique ID.
  *   Do not run multiple instances of the competition VMs.  Run a single c=
opy of any specific competition VM at a time (i.e., only run one copy of De=
bian 10 at a time).
  *   Do not perform major version upgrades on the provided operating syste=
ms.  For example, do not update Ubuntu 20 to Ubuntu 22 or Windows 10 to Win=
dows 11.  You can update applications and services if needed (and may need =
to on some critical applications).
  *   These VMs are used by different organizations for different purposes.=
  Each VM has a README file - check it to see what services are required, w=
ho the valid users are, what software packages are allowed or prohibited, a=
nd so on.  The link to the VM readme is on the desktop of each VM.
  *   You can "start over" using a fresh copy of any VM if you like, but th=
at will reset your score on that particular VM to zero.  Similarly, rolling=
 back a VM or restoring it to a specific snapshot will revert your score on=
 that VM to the score when that snapshot was made.  However, this does NOT =
reset your competition window =E2=80=93 just your score on that VM.  Your t=
eam=E2=80=99s 4-hour window keeps on running once it is started.
  *   Some forensics questions require more than one answer.  If that is th=
e case, make sure each answer is placed on a separate line and is preceded =
by "ANSWER:  ".
  *   Remember your goal is to "find and fix" as many issues as you can on =
each of these VMs.  You may find malware that needs to be removed, users wi=
th no passwords, no password policies, prohibited software, and so on.  The=
re are 100 points available on each VM.  Please note you may "correct" some=
thing that is not scored.
  *   Every VMs should automatically log you in with a user that has admin =
privileges.  You can change the password on the default account if you want=
 to.
  *   When you are finished playing, please shutdown or suspend your compet=
ition VMs.


Q:  What do we do at the end of our 4-hour window when we are done competin=
g?

A:  Power off your competition VMs and then delete them from your host syst=
ems.


Q:  What sort of tools/scripts can we use to secure these systems?

A:  You can use any open source, freeware, trialware, or openly published t=
ool or script.  Basically, if you didn't have to pay money for it then you =
can use it.


Q:  We have multiple teams running in the same building and/or coming from =
the same external IP address - is that okay?

A:  Absolutely.  As long the VMs have been registered with your Team's Uniq=
ue ID and can reach the scoring server on TCP port 80/443 then you will be =
fine.


Q:  What network connectivity do the VMs need?

A:  Just like the practice images, the competition images need to be able t=
o reach the scoring server on TCP ports 80 and 443.  You may also find that=
 Internet access on the VM is useful for downloading updates to application=
s like Firefox.


Q:  We have multiple teams; can they start at different times?

A:  Absolutely.  Each team's window starts when they power up their first V=
M.


Q:  Can we setup Active Directory and use that to manage the users?

A:  Absolutely - if you can get it working properly without interfering wit=
h the scoring system.


Q:  My scoring report doesn't seem to be updating.

A:  If your VM is connected to the scoring server, the local scoring report=
 should update every 60 seconds.  You can manually refresh the scoring repo=
rt as well by reloading the page.


Q:  Can you modify the resources allocated to the VMs (cores, drive size, m=
emory, etc.)?

A:  Yes.  As long as the VMs continue to boot and run you can change the re=
sources allocated to the VMs.


Q:  Are these OVAs unique to each team?

A:  No.  Every team gets the same images.  If have multiple teams and want =
to download one set of OVAs and copy them locally that=E2=80=99s fine.  Jus=
t verify the checksums on download and copy.


Q:  Can our team work together on the VMs or are we supposed to work on eac=
h VM separately.

A: Completely up to your team.  If you want to assign a VM to each team mem=
ber, work on one VM at a time as a team, or switch out who is working on wh=
at VM you are free to do so.  You just can=E2=80=99t collaborate with anyon=
e that=E2=80=99s not on your team.  And remember to not run more than one c=
opy of any specific competition VM at a time.


Q:  We=E2=80=99re planning on running our VMs in vSphere and we plan to do =
a single download, import the VMs, and then clone out a set for each team =
=E2=80=93 is that okay?

A:  Yes.  Just make sure none of the VMs are ever powered up until the team=
 is ready to start competing. Make sure the VMs are not accidentally powere=
d on during import.  If it does, delete it and import a fresh copy from the=
 OVA.



Sincerely,


The Hivestorm Team

<p>Dear Hivestorm Team Captain,</p>
<p>Please share this message with your coach and other team members. &nbsp;=
Our apologies for the text wall, but we want to provide you with as much in=
formation as we can ahead of time.&nbsp;
<strong><u>Please read this information carefully as failure to do so will =
cause issues for your team during the competition.</u></strong></p>
<p>The competition images are now available for download. &nbsp;You may dow=
nload, import, and stage these competition VMs but
<strong>DO NOT POWER ON ANY COMPETITION VMs UNTIL YOU ARE READY TO START YO=
UR COMPETITION WINDOW</strong>. &nbsp;When you power up
<strong><u>any</u></strong> of the competition VMs your team=E2=80=99s 4-ho=
ur window starts. There is no stopping, pausing, or resetting of competitio=
n windows once they=E2=80=99ve started.&nbsp; If your coach, captain, or an=
y team member powers up a competition VM before 10 AM
 Central on Oct 15th your team will be disqualified.</p>
<p>Before powering up any competition VMs, make sure the time on your host =
system is correct.&nbsp; Check that the time zone is correct and the host i=
s displaying the correct time for that time zone.&nbsp; This is especially =
critical for virtualization environments such
 as vSphere.&nbsp; If the time on the system hosting the VMs is wrong/off t=
hen it could prevent your VMs from scoring, may reduce your team=E2=80=99s =
competition window, and may prevent you from competing all together.&nbsp; =
We cannot make adjustments for host system time or
 time zone misconfigurations and will not be responsible for errors caused =
by an incorrect host system time =E2=80=93 be sure the time on your host is=
 correct before powering up any competition VMs!</p>
<p>There are 5 competition VMs - they may be downloaded from the following =

<p>The official competition window runs from 11 AM to 10 PM Central time on=
 Oct 15<sup>th</sup>. &nbsp;You can choose when you start playing within th=
at window, but you must start and complete your 4-hour competition window w=
ithin that timeframe. &nbsp;The VMs are set
 to UTC time - do not modify the time zone on the VMs. &nbsp;You may work o=
n the VMs one at a time or all at the same time just keep in mind you have =
a total of 4 hours from the time you power up that first competition image =
to achieve your highest score on all
 the competition VMs.&nbsp; The scoring server will stop =E2=80=9Ccounting=
=E2=80=9D scores for every team after their 4 hours is up so don=E2=80=99t =
worry if you see teams with a runtime longer than 4 hours on the scoreboard=
 (that just shows you which teams didn=E2=80=99t power off their VMs when
 they were finished =E2=80=93 they=E2=80=99re not getting a longer play win=

Z</a>. &nbsp;Please identify yourself with your team number on the Discord =
server. &nbsp;This Discord server is only manned during competition hours.<=
/p>
<p>A few technical notes to assist your team in this competition:</p>
<ul>
<li>Check your downloads =E2=80=93 SHA1 sums are provided above with the li=
nk to each VM.&nbsp; VMs are distributed in OVA format.</li><li>These VMs s=
hould work fine on the latest versions of VMWare Player/Workstation/ESXi/vS=
phere. &nbsp;You may be able to import and run them using VirtualBox, Proxm=
ox, or Hyper-V but these are not officially supported solutions and we will=
 not be able to help you
 get the VMs running in a non-supported environment.</li><li>If you are imp=
orting these VMs onto a platform without a sound card (like a server) you m=
ay want to remove the sound device from the VMs configuration before you po=
wer them up. &nbsp;If you do not remove the sound device before powering th=
e VM on a server platform
 you will get a prompt indicating the VM can't find a sound device and aski=
ng if you want to look for a sound device each time the VM restarts. &nbsp;=
You can safely answer &quot;no&quot; to that question. &nbsp;Check the moni=
tor tab in your web client for that VM if you don't
 see a pop-up question.</li><li>These VMs are setup for &quot;NAT&quot; whi=
ch means they are designed to share the IP address of the host system. &nbs=
p;You can modify the VMs to use DHCP or static IP addresses to fit your ope=
rating environment.</li><li>Enter your team's Unique ID into each VM as soo=
n as you power them up. &nbsp;You won't get any score or feedback until you=
 do and the VM will deactivate after a period of time without a valid Uniqu=
e ID.</li><li>Do not run multiple instances of the competition VMs. &nbsp;R=
un a single copy of any specific competition VM at a time (i.e., only run o=
ne copy of Debian 10 at a time).</li><li>Do not perform major version upgra=
des on the provided operating systems. &nbsp;For example, do not update Ubu=
ntu 20 to Ubuntu 22 or Windows 10 to Windows 11.&nbsp; You can update appli=
cations and services if needed (and may need to on some critical applicatio=
ns).</li><li>These VMs are used by different organizations for different pu=
rposes. &nbsp;Each VM has a README file - check it to see what services are=
 required, who the valid users are, what software packages are allowed or p=
rohibited, and so on.&nbsp; The link to the VM readme
 is on the desktop of each VM.</li><li>You can &quot;start over&quot; using=
 a fresh copy of any VM if you like, but that will reset your score on that=
 particular VM to zero. &nbsp;Similarly, rolling back a VM or restoring it =
to a specific snapshot will revert your score on that VM to the score when =
that snapshot
 was made.&nbsp; However, this does NOT reset your competition window =E2=
=80=93 just your score on that VM.&nbsp; Your team=E2=80=99s 4-hour window =
keeps on running once it is started.</li><li>Some forensics questions requi=
re more than one answer. &nbsp;If that is the case, make sure each answer i=
s placed on a separate line and is preceded by &quot;ANSWER: &nbsp;&quot;. =
&nbsp;</li><li>Remember your goal is to &quot;find and fix&quot; as many is=
sues as you can on each of these VMs. &nbsp;You may find malware that needs=
 to be removed, users with no passwords, no password policies, prohibited s=
oftware, and so on. &nbsp;There are 100 points available on each
 VM. &nbsp;Please note you may &quot;correct&quot; something that is not sc=
ored.</li><li>Every VMs should automatically log you in with a user that ha=
s admin privileges.&nbsp; You can change the password on the default accoun=
t if you want to.</li><li>When you are finished playing, please shutdown or=
 suspend your competition VMs.</li></ul>
<p><br>
</p>
<p>Q: &nbsp;What do we do at the end of our 4-hour window when we are done =
competing?</p>
<p>A: &nbsp;Power off your competition VMs and then delete them from your h=
ost systems.</p>
<p><br>
</p>
<p>Q: &nbsp;What sort of tools/scripts can we use to secure these systems?<=
/p>
<p>A: &nbsp;You can use any open source, freeware, trialware, or openly pub=
lished tool or script. &nbsp;Basically, if you didn't have to pay money for=
 it then you can use it.</p>
<p><br>
</p>
<p>Q: &nbsp;We have multiple teams running in the same building and/or comi=
ng from the same external IP address - is that okay?</p>
<p>A: &nbsp;Absolutely. &nbsp;As long the VMs have been registered with you=
r Team's Unique ID and can reach the scoring server on TCP port 80/443 then=
 you will be fine.</p>
<p><br>
</p>
<p>Q:&nbsp; What network connectivity do the VMs need?</p>
<p>A:&nbsp; Just like the practice images, the competition images need to b=
e able to reach the scoring server on TCP ports 80 and 443.&nbsp; You may a=
lso find that Internet access on the VM is useful for downloading updates t=
o applications like Firefox.</p>
<p><br>
</p>
<p>Q: &nbsp;We have multiple teams; can they start at different times?</p>
<p>A: &nbsp;Absolutely. &nbsp;Each team's window starts when they power up =
their first VM.</p>
<p><br>
</p>
<p>Q: &nbsp;Can we setup Active Directory and use that to manage the users?=
</p>
<p>A: &nbsp;Absolutely - if you can get it working properly without interfe=
ring with the scoring system.</p>
<p><br>
</p>
<p>Q: &nbsp;My scoring report doesn't seem to be updating.</p>
<p>A: &nbsp;If your VM is connected to the scoring server, the local scorin=
g report should update every 60 seconds. &nbsp;You can manually refresh the=
 scoring report as well by reloading the page.</p>
<p><br>
</p>
<p>Q: &nbsp;Can you modify the resources allocated to the VMs (cores, drive=
 size, memory, etc.)?</p>
<p>A: &nbsp;Yes. &nbsp;As long as the VMs continue to boot and run you can =
change the resources allocated to the VMs.</p>
<p><br>
</p>
<p>Q: &nbsp;Are these OVAs unique to each team?</p>
<p>A: &nbsp;No.&nbsp; Every team gets the same images.&nbsp; If have multip=
le teams and want to download one set of OVAs and copy them locally that=E2=
=80=99s fine.&nbsp; Just verify the checksums on download and copy.</p>
<p><br>
</p>
<p>Q:&nbsp; Can our team work together on the VMs or are we supposed to wor=
k on each VM separately.</p>
<p>A: Completely up to your team.&nbsp; If you want to assign a VM to each =
team member, work on one VM at a time as a team, or switch out who is worki=
ng on what VM you are free to do so.&nbsp; You just can=E2=80=99t collabora=
te with anyone that=E2=80=99s not on your team.&nbsp; And remember
 to not run more than one copy of any specific competition VM at a time.</p=
>
<p><br>
</p>
<p>Q:&nbsp; We=E2=80=99re planning on running our VMs in vSphere and we pla=
n to do a single download, import the VMs, and then clone out a set for eac=
h team =E2=80=93 is that okay?</p>
<p>A:&nbsp; Yes.&nbsp; Just make sure <strong><u>none</u></strong> of the V=
Ms are ever powered up until the team is ready to start competing. Make sur=
e the VMs are not accidentally powered on during import.&nbsp; If it does, =
delete it and import a fresh copy from the OVA.</p>
